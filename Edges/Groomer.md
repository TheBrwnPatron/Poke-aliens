    You know how to effectively groom your Pokémon with access to a Groomer’s
    Kit. You may groom up to 6 Pokémon in one hour. Grooming Pokémon may count
    as an hour of Training, and you may apply Experience Training, teach
    Poke-Edges, and apply any Features that could be applied during Training. If
    you apply Experience Training from Grooming, use your General Education or
    Pokémon Education Rank to determine Bonus Experience gained during Training.
    A Pokémon that has been Groomed also gains a +1d6 Bonus to the Introduction
    Roll of a Contest for the rest of the day.
