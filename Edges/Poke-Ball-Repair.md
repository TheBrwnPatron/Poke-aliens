    You may attempt to fix any Poké Ball that has failed to capture a Pokémon
    and broke. Make a Technology Check with a DC of 15. If you succeed, the Poké
    Ball is fixed and is treated as if it had not broken. If you fail, the ball
    is permanently broken. Requires access to a Poké Ball Tool Box.
